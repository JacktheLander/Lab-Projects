In Neuromorphic Computing by [Professor Dat Tran](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10011415?figureId=fig2#fig2), I learned about high-performance, energy-efficient computing and the related challenges and opportunities. Multi-core systems improve processing speed, but are limited by energy constraints. Neuromorphic computing, which mimics the efficiency of the brain, uses advanced nanodevices such as memristors and memcapacitors. We learn about Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and how memristors and memcapacitors function like synapses. We also explore using Echo State Networks (ESNs) in Reservoir Computing (RC).
