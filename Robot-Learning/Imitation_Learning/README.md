As part of my Master's in AI Engineering, I completed a report on Robot Imitation Learning from Kinesthetic Teaching.

The focus was on how robots can learn generalized behaviors directly from human demonstrations.

Projects like this have been especially interesting to me because they sit at the intersection of controls, machine learning, and human-robot interation.

I'm excited to continue exploring robot learning systems that can move from theory to pracice.
